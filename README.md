# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship - Task 04

## Overview
This repository contains the work completed for Task 04 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science internship. The objective of this task was to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

## Task Description
### Task 04: Analyze and Visualize Sentiment Patterns
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Ensured the dataset was prepared for analysis.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyzed sentiment patterns using TextBlob library.
   - Calculated polarity scores to determine sentiment.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Created various plots such as histograms, pie charts, and word clouds to visualize sentiment patterns.
   - Explored relationships between sentiment and other variables.

## Visualizations
- **Histograms**: Used to display the distribution of sentiment polarity.
- **Pie Charts**: Used to show the proportion of different sentiment categories.
- **Word Clouds**: Generated for positive and negative sentiments to visualize frequently occurring words.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the Twitter Sentiments Analysis dataset, which can be downloaded from [Kaggle - Twitter Sentiments Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis).
